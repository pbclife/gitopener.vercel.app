# Dummy

Dummy is a content generation toolkit designed to make the development, testing and presentation of web prototypes less time consuming and more realistic. It does so by making it easy to populate static HTML with dynamic content, and by randomizing elements within a layout on subsequent loads of a document, in a way, simulating connectivity to a live database.

Originally conceived as a tool for helping to simulate the high volume, rapidly changing content characteristics of online newspapers and magazines, it's generalized enough to benefit the early stage front-end development of any website or application with content that frequently changes in length, form or nature.

Dummy can be useful in the early stages of a project's development, where basic questions and assumptions about how to architect the front-end must be tested and resolved to conclusion before engineers further down the Gantt diagram can begin their work of obfuscating yours.

It can also been seen as a support tool for designers and front-end artisans ready to embrace the dark art of designing in-browser, as vastly different layout permutations can be generated and evaluated rapidly with each load of the page. Problems and shortcommings can be more quickly exposed.

### Dummy can…

- Insert randomly selected strings of placeholder text in various lengths and formats (e.g. headline, teaser, paragraph).
- Automagically crop and size high quality, news worthy, Creative Commons licensed placeholder images from a default pool – or from a specific folder or subset of folders that you provide.
- Flesh out highly variable, asset rich layouts quickly with friendly, human-readable logic for building loops and controlling probability.
- Allow you to focus on the important things – namely, the design and the code – not on copying and pasting (static) Lorem Ipsum, or hunting down plausible placeholder images.
- More. Not lots more, but a _bit_ more!

### More Info

Dummy's primary goal is to provide tools that speed front-end prototyping and QA. Whether you're meticulously crafting a fully responsive site with a myriad of CSS breakpoints, or just slapping together a half-baked idea – using Dummy should make it easier _at the earliest stages of development_ to visualize, test and present something much closer to what your actual front-end will become under a variety of different conditions.
