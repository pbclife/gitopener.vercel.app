# What is Git?

1. Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes made to files and folders over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has become one of the most widely used version control systems in software development.

2. Git allows you to create a repository, which is essentially a directory that contains all the files and folders related to a project. As you make changes to these files, Git tracks these changes and allows you to view the history of changes, revert to previous versions of files, and collaborate with other developers on the same project.

3. Git uses a distributed model, which means that each developer has their own copy of the repository and can make changes to it independently. These changes can then be merged together into a master copy of the repository.

4. Git is a command-line tool, but there are also many graphical user interfaces available that make it easier to use. It is open-source software and can be used on a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
