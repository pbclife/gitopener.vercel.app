# What is an issue?

1. An issue in GitHub is a feature that allows you to track bugs, feature requests, or other tasks related to a project. Issues can be used to report bugs or suggest improvements, and can be assigned to individual developers or teams. Issues can also be tagged with labels, which make it easier to organize and prioritize them.
