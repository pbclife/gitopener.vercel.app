# How to write professional commits ?

To write professional commits in GitHub, it's important to follow a few best practices:

- Write clear, concise commit messages that describe the changes you've made.
- Use imperative verbs in your commit messages to describe what the change does.
- Break up large changes into smaller commits that are easier to review.
- Use a consistent style for your commits, such as starting with a verb and using the present tense.

# Here are some examples of good commit messages:

- `feat`: Introduces a new feature or functionality.
- `fix`: Fixes a bug or error in the codebase.
- `chore`: Performs changes that do not relate to a fix or feature, such as updating dependencies, build configurations, and so on.
- `refactor`: Performs changes to the code that neither fix a bug nor add a feature, such as improving code readability or restructuring code.
- `docs`: Performs updates to the documentation, such as README files, inline comments, or other markdown files.
- `style`: Performs changes that do not affect the code's meaning, such as code formatting, whitespace, or styling.
- `test`: Includes new tests or correcting previous tests to ensure code quality.
- `perf`: Implements performance improvements that enhance the code's speed or efficiency.
- `ci`: Performs changes related to the continuous integration or delivery process.
- `build`: Performs changes that affect the build system, external dependencies, or deployment scripts.
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit due to errors or issues that arose.
