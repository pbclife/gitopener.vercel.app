# How to write professional commits ?

To write professional commits in GitHub, it's important to follow a few best practices.

## The conventional way:

` type` `scope ` : `description`

- `type` : Commit Type like build, ci, docs, feat, fix etc. This field is mandatory.

- `scope` : Phrase describing a section of the codebase. This field is optional.

- `description` : description should be in the present tense. Not capitalized. No period in the end. Each description consists of a Title, Body and Footer. The Title and Body are mandatory if the description is large enough. The footer is optional.

#### The command :

git commit -m "`type_of_commit(optional scope)`: `description_title/description`" -m "`description body(optional)`" -m "`description footer(optional)`"

#### The Example:

git commit -m "`docs(guides)`: `change in how to write professional commit`" -m "`fix spelling mistake, add example`" -m "`fixes issue #120`"

## Rules & Specification:

- Write clear, concise commit messages that describe the changes you've made.
- Use a consistent style for your commits, such as starting with a verb and using the present tense.
- All words should be lowercase.
- No dot (.) at the end of the description.
- Use imperative verbs in your commit messages to describe what the change does.
- Break up large changes into smaller commits to review.
- The footer should contain additional issue references about the code changes.

## Type of Commits:

- `feat`: Introduces a new feature or functionality.
- `fix`: Fixes a bug or error in the codebase.
- `chore`: Performs changes that do not relate to a fix or feature, such as updating dependencies, building configurations, and so on.
- `refactor`: Performs changes to the code that neither fixes a bug nor add a feature, such as improving code readability or restructuring code.
- `docs`: Performs updates to the documentation, such as README files, inline comments, or other markdown files.
- `style`: Performs changes that do not affect the code's meaning, such as code formatting, whitespace, or styling.
- `test`: Includes new tests or correcting previous tests to ensure code quality.
- `perf`: Implements performance improvements that enhance the code's speed or efficiency.
- `ci`: Performs changes related to the continuous integration or delivery process.
- `build`: Performs changes that affect the build system, external dependencies, or deployment scripts.
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit due to errors or issues that arose.

## Some examples of good commit messages:

1.  #### Commit message with no body or footer

    docs: correct spelling in README.md file

2.  #### Commit message with a body

    feat: change color on hover

    add color change in background while hover

3.  #### Commit message with a body and footer

    fix: solve the scroll issue

    see the issue for details

    fixes issue #85

4.  #### Commit message with scope

    docs(guide/migration): fix spelling mistake
