# What is GitHub?

1. GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a hosting service for Git repositories. It allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on their code and projects. GitHub was launched in 2008 and has since become the largest host of source code in the world, with over 100 million repositories.

2. GitHub provides a number of features that make it easier for developers to collaborate on projects. For example, it allows users to create issues, which are used to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to the project. Users can also create pull requests, which are used to propose changes to the codebase. Other users can review these changes and suggest modifications before they are merged into the main branch.

3. GitHub also provides a number of social features, such as the ability to follow other users and receive notifications when they make changes to their repositories. Users can also star repositories to show their appreciation for a project, or fork a repository to create their own version of the project.

4. GitHub is used by millions of developers and companies around the world, and has become an essential tool for open-source projects, as well as for many commercial software projects.
