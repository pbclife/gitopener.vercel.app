# What is Open Source?

1. Open source can be described as for suppose if we are working on a large , medium , small chunk projects in an organization or project form it involves large code so due to human nature we may make mistakes or some errors which leads to complications.

2. We can make it available to public using platforms like Github which promotes collaboration and can help an individual find solutions in ease by community collaboration.

3. Here public audience can collaborate and rectify the mistakes if found and can make a pull request with changes suggested if it resolves the problem and after checking code efficiency and output we can push to main branch if it works without always disturbing the main branch.

4. Here collaboration also improves along with chances of profile visibility and we can be part of knowledge sharing as part of our contribution which adds value in long run and also promotes working on code.

5. Open source collaborations in the form of **_Code and Non Code_** play a significant role in a project.

6. Here we can use open source opportunity using **_Version Control Systems (VCS)_** like Github.
