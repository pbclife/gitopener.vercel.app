# What is branch?

1. A branch in GitHub is a copy of the repository codebase that is used to work on a specific set of changes. Branches allow multiple developers to work on different parts of a project simultaneously, without interfering with each other's work. Changes made in a branch can later be merged back into the main branch or into other branches.
